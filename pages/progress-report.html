                Probably the most productive meeting to date lol.

                Each team lead presented on what their respective group discussed.

                Not much progress was made, and there was barely any research from each team
            </li>
            <li>
                Teams need to be interacting more, everyone decide on team leads.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Team leads need to set up an agenda for their teams each week and bring it to
the weekly meetings.

                This week we discussed necessary tasks for us to start the project.
            </li>
            <li>
                We decided that
the overall project was to design and manufacture an electric street bike.
            </li>
            <li>
                In order to move
forward so that all teams can begin their own work/objectives, we need to research how to
design the bike, components needed for each team, and create a budget so that we can
begin designing.
            </li>
            <li>
                Since it will take some time to collect research from all teams, finance
(Madi and Elijah) will have through next week to create the budget sheet.
            </li>
            <li>
                All teams should
aim to have their research in by next Friday.
            </li>
            <li>
                All teams should also be deciding on team
                leads.
            </li>
